# Machine-Learning-Projects
A basic example is created for predicting and using machine learning models to see how they perform on real world data

## STABLE DIFFUSION MODEL
Imported the latest version of stable diffusion model from hugging face and created an interface, for interacting and making the images from prompt. This model runs on CPU and hence takes a long time to run.
The machine type can be made to cuda in case a GPU is available for faster processing of images. A react front-end can be created and can interact with this python backend and that part of the code will be added
later.
